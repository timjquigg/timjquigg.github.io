                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Professional Engineer from Calgary with 8 years of experience in the oil and gas sector and more than 4 years in the automotive service section starting out my journey as a web developer.</p>
                <p>I always enjoyed learning computer programming in highschool and university but never thought about making it a career until the recent declines in traditional engineering jobs in Calgary in oil and gas. In highschool I recieved an introduction to writing programs in Java. In university I took a course in the C programming language and used those skills to perform calculations throughtou my university program.</p>
                <p>Once I entered the engineering workforce, my computer programming sat mostly on the back burner. I occasionally wrote automations in Microsoft Excel using Visual Basic. But for the most part, my coding muscles sat dormant.</p>
                <p>The lagging oil and gas industries in Calgary have really made me re-examine what I want to be doing and as my wife asked me last year "what I wanted to do when I grow up." Funny to think of being asked that question already 10+ years into the workforce. But it reminded me of the excitement I always experience when designing an algorithm or the joy I recieved when I finally figured out a bug and my code gave me the results I was expecting.</p>
                <p>So better late than never, I'm honing my coding skills and looking to transition to a career in development!</p>
