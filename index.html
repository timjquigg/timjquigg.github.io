                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div id="bio">
                    <p>I am a Professional Engineer from Calgary with 8 years of experience in the oil and gas sector and more than 4 years in the automotive service section starting out my journey as a web developer.</p>
                    <p>I always enjoyed learning computer programming in highschool and university but never thought about making it a career until the recent declines in traditional engineering jobs in Calgary in oil and gas. In highschool I recieved an introduction to writing programs in Java. In university I took a course in the C programming language and used those skills to perform calculations throughout my university program.</p>
                    <p>Once I entered the engineering workforce, my computer programming sat mostly on the back burner. I occasionally wrote automations in Microsoft Excel using Visual Basic. But for the most part, my coding muscles sat dormant.</p>
                    <p>The lagging oil and gas industries in Calgary have really made me re-examine what I want to be doing and as my wife asked me last year "what I wanted to do when I grow up." Funny to think of being asked that question already 10+ years into the workforce. But it reminded me of the excitement I always experienced when designing an algorithm or the joy I recieved when I finally figured out a bug and my code gave finally me the results I was expecting.</p>
                    <p>So better late than never, I'm honing my coding skills and looking to transition to a career in development!</p>

                        <p>This was a project I created while working through the Full Stack Engineer career path at <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a>. The project was to make a responsive website for a club. My wife suggested a "club" for toddlers to get together and play. I thought that was a good idea so made a website for a fictional dayhome.</p>
                        <p>This webpage was created in VS Code using HTML and CSS.</p>

                            <p>This was another project I created while working through the Full Stack Engineer career path at <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a>. This program was written to randomly assign a Scotch whisky region to each guest attending a whisky tasting night. My group of friends and I enjoy whisky tasting evenings and this was a fun way to make sure that everyone brought a bottle from a different region to highlight the different styles and flavor profiles. I had previously made a similar program using python. </p>
                            <p>This program was written in javascript using VS Code and run using Node JS.</p>
